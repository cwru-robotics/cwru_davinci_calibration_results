# cwru_davinci_calibration_results

This package stores calibration results of the dvrk robot at Case Western Reserve University.
This respository is necessary because it currently takes a lot of effort to generate calibration results.

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. The calibration results are very sensitive to gross robotic motion and consequently are not stable.
2. The purpose of this repo is to easily share calibration results accross users.
3. If calibration becomes more routine (~15 mins) then the this repo can be deleted.
4. The camera calibration results (intrinsics etc) are also stored here.
